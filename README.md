# BeingDubai_Website

This project is a multi-page responsive website built to showcase the offerings of *Being Emotional Wellness, ASA Clinics*. The website aims to promote emotional healing, inner strength, and holistic retreats conducted in luxurious and high-energy healing environments. It includes key sections such as a homepage (index.html), a services page, and a gallery page to visually represent real sessions and events. The design is clean and modern, reflecting the calming essence of wellness and self-care.

Developed using HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 5, the site is fully responsive across devices. The layout is structured to guide users through emotional wellness journeys, provide session booking options, and share images from past events through a grid-style gallery. Footer sections across all pages contain consistent contact information and branding. Navigation is smooth, with internal linking across all three main pages (Home, Services, and Gallery).

All images are optimized and laid out in equal-width columns, and styling ensures visual balance through margins and spacing. The codebase is cleanly structured with separate folders for images and CSS files. This project was created as part of a front-end development practice and is ideal for showcasing modern HTML/CSS design skills on a GitHub portfolio. To view the website locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in any modern browser.

Authored by Darshan S B, this project serves as a professional demonstration of web development skills focused on layout design, responsiveness, and aesthetic content presentation.
